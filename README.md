   Arduino Electronics Introduction
================================================================================

**[Work In Progress]**

This workshop is designed to provide an introduction to the arduino hardware
and software platform. Participants will learn how to connect to and program the
arduino, and interface with various sensors and outputs.

A Note on the worksheets: These worksheets were created using a program called
Libra Office Draw. It is similar to Microsoft Publisher but it is free! If you
are using windows then it is recomended you look at the PDF Versions of the 
files or they might not work correctly.
